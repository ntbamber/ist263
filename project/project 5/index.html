        <p>Welcome to your guide to disc golf! Disc golf is a sport that has rapidly grown in popularity during the early 2020s, and for good reasons. It combines the fun of being outdoors with the challenge of throwing a flying disc into a basket in as few throws as possible.</p>

        <p>The sport has its roots in the 1970s, when players began creating official courses and rules. Since then, disc golf has spread worldwide, with thousands of courses in parks, schools, and even private properties. There are even courses in Antarctica, Uganda, and Mongolia.</p>

        <p>Why do people love disc golf? For starters, it’s affordable and accessible- most courses are free to play and all you need is a few discs to get started. It’s also a sport for all ages and skill levels, offering a great way to spend time with friends, exercise in nature, or compete in organized tournaments.</p>

        <p>While most players prefer using specialized disc golf discs, you can get started with only one disc or even a traditional catch disc. Disc golf is fun for all activity levels, regardless of if you throw 50 feet or 500 feet.</p>

        <p>Some of the benefits of disc golf include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Exercise and movement while walking the course.</li>
          <li>Stress relief from spending time outdoors.</li>
          <li>Community and connection with other players.</li>
          <li>Challenge and strategy, as each course and hole offers something different.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Take a look at some photos of scenic courses- you’ll see why disc golf is such an exciting and rewarding hobby!</p>

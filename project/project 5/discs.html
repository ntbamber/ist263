        <p>Discs are an important part of the game, and each one has a specific role. Disc golfers use different discs for different scenarios depending on if you need more distance, control, or accuracy. Most beginners will be able to play with just a fairway driver, mid-range, and putter, but your bag will most likely grow as you grow in the sport.</p>

            <p>These discs are built for maximum distance. With a sharp edge and short but thick rim, drivers cut through the air and travel far. They’re best for long throws off the tee, but the thick rim can make them harder for beginners to control.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Typical Speed Range:</strong> 9 - 15</p>

            <strong>Recommended Distance Drivers for Beginners:</strong> Innova Gorgon, Discraft Avenger SS, MVP Trail

          <dt><strong>Fairway Drivers</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A step down in speed from distance drivers. Easier to control and more predictable—great for beginners or for shots that need accuracy over pure distance.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Typical Speed Range:</strong> 6 - 9</p>

            <strong>Recommended Fairway Drivers for Beginners:</strong> Innova Leopard, Latitude 64 River, Axiom Crave

          <dt><strong>Mid-Range Discs</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Versatile for medium-distance throws. A balance of distance and control and perfect for approaches. Many players use mid-ranges as their go-to discs when learning.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Typical Speed Range:</strong> 4 - 6</p>

            <strong>Recommended Mid-Range Discs for Beginners:</strong> Discraft Buzzz, Innova Roc, Axiom Hex

          <dt><strong>Putters</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The slowest but most accurate discs. Designed for short throws and putting. Also useful for controlled approaches when you don’t want extra glide.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Typical Speed Range:</strong> 1 - 4</p>

            <strong>Recommended Putters for Beginners:</strong> Innova Aviar, Dynamic Discs Judge, Latitude 64 Pure

        <h2 id="flight-numbers">Understanding Flight Numbers</h2>
      
        <p>Most discs show four numbers (e.g., <em>9 / 5 / -2 / 1</em>) that summarize how the disc is intended to fly. Treat these as a <strong>comparison guide</strong>, not exact physics—they’re based on ideal throws and can vary by thrower, plastic, weight, wind, and elevation. The goal is to help you compare molds and pick what fits your throw. (Assume a right-hand backhand, RHBH, unless noted.)</p>
      
        <p><strong>What is RHBH?</strong> A right-hand backhand means a right-handed player grips the disc across the chest, pulls across the body, and releases in front. For RHBH throws, “turn” describes early movement to the <em>right</em> and “fade” describes the disc’s late finish to the <em>left</em>.</p>

        <strong>How to read flight numbers:</strong>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/2-4.png" alt="Close-up of a disc stamp showing four flight numbers">
          <figcaption>Most discs print four numbers—Speed / Glide / Turn / Fade—right on the stamp.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> how much <em>power</em> the disc needs to fly as designed. Higher numbers generally demand more arm speed and often correlate with wider rims. If you under-power a fast disc, it tends to behave more overstable and fade out early.</li>
          <li><strong>Glide:</strong> how well the disc <em>stays aloft</em>. More glide helps newer players add easy carry; experienced players may prefer less glide for wind control and precise landings.</li>
          <li><strong>Turn (high-speed stability):</strong> early-flight movement. Negative values (e.g., -3) mean the disc will drift right on a RHBH throw (understable), which can help beginners throw straighter and farther; 0 or positive values resist that turn (stable to overstable).</li>
          <li><strong>Fade (low-speed stability):</strong> late-flight finish. Bigger fade (e.g., 4) means a stronger left finish for RHBH—useful for wind, skip finishes, or predictable hyzers. Small fade (0–1) lands straighter.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p><strong>How to use this in real life:</strong> start with lower Speed, neutral-to-understable Turn, and moderate Glide to match typical beginner power. As your form and arm speed grow, move into faster or more overstable options. Remember, manufacturer numbers are a <em>baseline</em>; pairing them with community/review-driven ratings can better reflect how discs actually fly for players at different skill levels. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

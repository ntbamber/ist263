        <p>Discs are an important part of the game, and each one has a specific role. Disc golfers use different discs for different scenarios depending on if you need more distance, control, or accuracy.</p>

          <dt><strong>Drivers</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>These discs are built for maximum distance. With a sharp edge and short but thick rim, drivers cut through the air and travel far. They’re best for long throws off the tee, but the thick rim can make them harder for beginners to control.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Typical Speed Range:</strong> 9 - 15</p>

            <strong>Recommended Distance Drivers for Beginners:</strong> Innova Gorgon, Discraft Avenger SS, MVP Trail

          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><strong>Fairway Drivers</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A step down in speed from distance drivers. Easier to control and more predictable—great for beginners or for shots that need accuracy over pure distance.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Typical Speed Range:</strong> 6 - 9</p>

            <strong>Recommended Fairway Drivers for Beginners:</strong> Innova Leopard, Latitude 64 River, Axiom Crave

          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><strong>Mid-Range Discs</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Versatile for medium-distance throws. A balance of distance and control and perfect for approaches. Many players use mid-ranges as their go-to discs when learning.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Typical Speed Range:</strong> 4 - 6</p>

            <strong>Recommended Mid-Range Discs for Beginners:</strong> Discraft Buzzz, Innova Roc, Axiom Hex

          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><strong>Putters</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The slowest but most accurate discs. Designed for short throws and putting. Also useful for controlled approaches when you don’t want extra glide.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Typical Speed Range:</strong> 1 - 4</p>

            <strong>Recommended Putters for Beginners:</strong> Innova Aviar, Dynamic Discs Judge, Latitude 64 Pure

        <h2 id="flight-numbers">Understanding Flight Numbers</h2>
        <p>Each disc has a “flight pattern” that shows how it will travel when thrown correctly. Drivers usually have long, curving flights, while putters tend to fly straight and drop quickly. As you gain experience, you’ll learn how to pick the right disc for the situation.</p>
        <strong>How to read flight numbers:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> how much power the disc needs to fly correctly.</li>
          <li><strong>Glide:</strong> how well the disc stays in the air.</li>
          <li><strong>Turn:</strong> the early tendency of the disc to turn right (RHBH throw).</li>
          <li><strong>Fade:</strong> how much the disc hooks left at the end (RHBH throw).</li>
        </ul>

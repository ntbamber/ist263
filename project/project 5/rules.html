        <p>Learning the rules of disc golf is simple and makes the game fun for everyone. A round of disc golf is played with each hole having a designated starting point (the tee) and ending point (the basket).</p>

        <p><strong>How a Round Works</strong></p>

        <p>Each player takes turns throwing their disc from the tee.</p>

        <p>After the first throw, players continue from the spot where their disc landed.</p>

        <p>The goal is to get your disc into the basket in as few throws as possible.</p>

        <p><strong>Scoring</strong><br>Disc golf uses the same scoring terms as traditional golf:</p>

        <p><strong>Par:</strong> The expected number of throws it should take to complete a hole.</p>

        <p><strong>Stroke:</strong> Each throw counts as one stroke.</p>

        <p><strong>Birdie:</strong> Completing a hole in one throw under par.</p>

        <p><strong>Bogey:</strong> Completing a hole in one throw over par.</p>

        <strong>Basic Rules:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Throw from behind your lie (the spot where your disc landed).</li>
          <li>If a disc goes out of bounds, add one penalty stroke and throw again from the drop zone or where it exited.</li>
          <li>Player farthest from the basket throws first.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Disc golf is designed to be fun, so while rules matter, the main goal is to enjoy the game and keep improving!</p>
